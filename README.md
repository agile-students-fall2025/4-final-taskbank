# Taskbank - Smart Task Planner

## Product Vision Statement

**For students and busy professionals who struggle to maintain effective todo lists and get overwhelmed by lengthy task backlogs, Taskbank is a web-based smart task planner that automatically generates optimized daily task lists using GTD (Getting Things Done) principles. Unlike traditional todo apps that simply display all tasks, our product intelligently organizes work based on context, priority, deadlines, and dependencies to help users focus on what matters most each day.**

## Project Description

In the digital age with tons of distractions and things to do, it is easy to get lost in endless task lists and digital apps. Taskbank is a web-based todo application that goes beyond simple task management by automatically creating daily task lists tailored to your workload, priorities, and context.

### Key Features

- **Intelligent Task Sorting**: Automatically sorts tasks based on importance, deadlines, and dependencies
- **Context-Based Filtering**: Filter tasks by context (Office, School, Home, Daily Life), location, and custom tags
- **Project Management**: Create projects consisting of multiple interconnected tasks
- **Smart Daily Planning**: Automatically generates optimized daily task lists when you first launch the app each day
- **Customizable Workload**: Adjust the number of tasks in your daily list to match your capacity
- **Time Tracking**: Add estimated effort and time required for each task
- **Integration**: Sync with Google Tasks and export tasks to your calendar
- **Gamification**: Track performance stats, completion streaks, and receive grades based on consistency

### Who Is This For?

Taskbank is designed for everyone who needs task management, but specifically targets:
- Students managing coursework, assignments, and extracurricular activities
- Professionals juggling multiple projects and responsibilities
- Anyone who has struggled to maintain consistent todo lists
- People who get overwhelmed by lengthy task backlogs

## Project History

Taskbank was conceived from the observation that many people struggle with traditional todo list applications. While there are countless task management tools available, most simply present users with an overwhelming list of tasks without guidance on what to focus on each day. 

Our team recognized that the problem isn't tracking tasks - it's prioritizing and organizing them effectively. By combining GTD principles with intelligent automation, Taskbank aims to solve the core problem: helping users maintain sustainable, productive task management habits without feeling overwhelmed.

## Project Scope

### What Makes This Feasible

Taskbank is designed with modularity in mind. The core todo list functionality serves as a foundation upon which additional features can be built incrementally. Features can be added, modified, or removed without disrupting the entire system, making the project manageable within our timeline.

### What Makes This Appropriately Challenging

The intelligent task sorting algorithm, context-aware filtering, and integration with external services (Google Tasks, Calendar) require careful design and implementation. The user interface must balance functionality with simplicity, creating a smooth user experience that doesn't feel limiting. These challenges make the project substantial without being overwhelming.

## Technology Stack

**MERN Stack**

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
